# IEVS.js

Infinitely Extendable Voting System Comparison Engine

Port of Warren D. Smith's open source IEVS.c (see `./reference/ievs.c`) to javascript, to make it more modern more modular and extendible, and more accessible to the masses of JS programmers out there to play with.

# TODO

- tests!
- release on npm
- add "Ignorance", "Honesty" and "Strategy" functions
- port more of the more complex utility functions and voting methods
- replicate Dr. Smith's famous BR charts
- experiment with more utility functions, maybe based on real world data
- experiment with fancy newfangled voting methods (SRV, 3-2-1)


# Further Ideas

Lots of fun stuff could be done with this:

- connect to highcharts or similar, to make pretty graphs
- connect to https://github.com/ncase/ballot to get visualisations of particular elections?
- make it easy to write a new utility function or a new voting method, and release as a plugin for others to collaborate
